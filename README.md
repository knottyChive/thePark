# thePark
A Rick and Morty Front End Project that shows all the characters and locations.

Welcome to the Github for the Park.

## Purpose: 
I created a frontend for the Rick and Morty API. I wanted more experience designing and planning projects going forward so I started a redesign of my projects,
With that this wonderful piece came about. 

## Technologies Used:
React, React-Router-DOM, React-Bootstrap, Axios, SASS, and Figma. 
Deployed on Netlify!

## How it went:
I did change a few things from my original wireframe but I felt that it would look better. I didn't change the layout though, just the colors. 

## Could it be better:
Heck Yeah! I will be revisiting this project for a few improvemnents in the new year 2021.
